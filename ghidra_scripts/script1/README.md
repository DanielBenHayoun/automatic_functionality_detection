this script create a ghidra project(tmp_ghidra_project) including .rep folder and .gpr file.
the result of the decompilation will be found at res/output.c
you can try and re-compile it (need adjusments to C code) 
*mind that if you want to run the script again with the same binary, you need to delete these project files
